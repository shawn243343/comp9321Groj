952,Spain,"Dusty stone-fruit aromas suggest yeast and nectarine. This varietal Xarel-lo feels citrusy and spunky; flavors of melon, orange and nectarine are good but standard on the finish. Overall, this is linear and fairly basic for white wine.",87,16.0,Agustí Torelló Mata,Xarel-lo,Agustí Torelló Mata 2015 XIC Xarel-lo (Penedès)
953,US,"This new “i” series offering mixes brambly strawberry fruit with granular tannins. It's ready to drink, dappled with cinnamon, and leaves a slightly medicinal aftertaste in the back of the mouth.",87,38.0,Amalie Robert,Pinot Noir,Amalie Robert 2012 i Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
954,US,"Full-bodied and smooth in texture, this generous-tasting wine has lots of ripe plum flavors and sweet-seeming oak accents.",87,15.0,Archgate Cellars,Cabernet Sauvignon,Archgate Cellars 2014 Reserve Bottling Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi)
955,Italy,"This offers scents and flavors that recall stewed prune, raisin and black pepper. It's still tight, with aggressive tannins that leave a firm clenching finish. Give it a few years to let the tannins unfurl then drink up to capture the remaining fruit.",87,50.0,Bersano,Nebbiolo,Bersano 2012 Nirvasco  (Barolo)
956,Italy,"Here's a fun, informal sparkler that has aromas of citrus, orchard fruit and toast. The racy palate shows golden apple, pear, bitter almond and a lemon drop note.",87,30.0,Cantine di Marzo,Greco,Cantine di Marzo NV Anni Venti Metodo Classico  (Greco di Tufo)
957,US,"The great Ritchie Vineyard, a renowned site for Chardonnay, also possesses highly sought-after Sauvignon Blanc.

958,Spain,"Crisp plum and red-bell-pepper aromas lead to a healthy, mostly fresh palate with some weight to it. A mix of citrus and red-plum flavors ends long, without much, if any, unwanted pithiness or bitterness.",87,18.0,Ignacio Marín,Rosé,Ignacio Marín 2015 Wine Wings Garnacha Rosé (Cariñena)
959,France,"Partially from Grand Cru vineyards in the Montagne de Reims and the Côte des Blancs, this wine is soft, ripe and balanced, with a ripe dosage that contrasts with citrus acidity. It has a fine, cool texture.",87,40.0,Jacquart,Champagne Blend,Jacquart NV Brut Mosaïque  (Champagne)
960,France,"This is a fragrant, spicy wine that is shot through with red fruits and fine acidity. The 95% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Sauvignon blend is still firm with its tannins although the acidity and bright fruit are well in balance. Drink from 2018.",87,18.0,Château Cap Saint-Martin,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Cap Saint-Martin 2014  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux
961,France,This is a ripe wine and full of fruit. It has structure as well with its firm tannins and smoky backdrop. It will broaden out well and give a rich wine from 2018.,87,20.0,Château de Bel,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château de Bel 2014  Bordeaux Supérieur

963,France,"From a large 177-acre estate in the southern Graves, this wine shows plenty of stalky, black currant fruits, fresh acidity and spice from wood.

964,Italy,"Here's a Trebbiano-based wine from the Lake Garda area in northern Italy that delivers smooth consistency and expressive notes of stone fruit, citrus, honey and crushed stone. The wine would pair well with lake fish or vegetable dishes.",85,17.0,Fabiano,Trebbiano,Fabiano 2006 Argillaia  (Lugana)
965,Italy,"Packaged in a heavy, oversized black bottle, this brawny wine delivers power, bulging muscle and aromas that exaggerate in every way possible. The most noticeable feature (so noticeable, it knocks you in the face) is the wood element that comes off as fresh carpentry or wood shavings. The wine is heavy, syrupy and sweet tasting.",85,48.0,Vinosia,Primitivo,Vinosia 2006 Vecchie Vigne  (Primitivo di Manduria)
966,New Zealand,"The 2004 and 2005 vintages of this wine were priced at $15, which gives some idea how fast the supply of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc has increased. Kono's 2008 is on the light side, but tart and zippy, with a refreshing aspect to its pineapple and grapefruit flavors and herbal overtones. Drink now.",85,9.0,Kono,Sauvignon Blanc,Kono 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
967,Chile,"Light and tropical, with buttercup aromas and a touch of citrus. The palate is plump and slightly oily, but with good acidity.

Drink right away.",85,10.0,Santa Ema,Chardonnay,Santa Ema 2008 Selected Terroir Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley)
969,Chile,"Good introductory Carmenère. It's a touch green, which is common for this quality level, but there's also some coconut and mild burnt aromas to wade through.

975,Italy,"Fabio Sireci is behind some of Sicily's best Nero d'Avola and has more recently decided to flex his winemaker muscle on Pinot Noir.

980,Italy,"This wine doesn't seem to have fully evolved and its aromas are  muddled in places with notes of mature fruit and natural rubber.

985,Argentina,"Coconut and dill aromas rise from the nose, and they are surrounded by berry, cassis and floral scents. The palate is tight, honest and a little hard, with middle-of-the-road berry flavors tinged with herbs. There's size and power to this wine, but also balance.

988,US,"This is a classic, high-acid vintage. The strength is fruit, and it's a mix of citrus and light pineapple; all stainless fermented and finished at moderate alcohol. Quite different in style from the '06, but well-made.",88,20.0,Lachini,Pinot Gris,Lachini 2007 Pinot Gris (Oregon)
989,Spain,"Mauro will always show you a lot, but frankly this 2005 seems soft and chunky. It has rich, baked, black-fruit aromas and then a mildly syrupy palate with huge blackberry and cassis flavors. The finish is wide and rich, but where are the tannins and structure that this wine is known for? Drink now for best results; it may not improve in the cellar.
