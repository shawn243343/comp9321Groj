Here we use linear model to predict wine price.
the parameters we got from trained model are showing below:
w1=-0.1073
w2= 0.0821
w3= 0.2896

Note: There is no intercept, since model can have a better perfermance without intercept.
w1 is for Country
w2 is for winery
w3 is for variety

When user input these three info, it should be found a corresponding value(number) in dict we provided, 
then doing following calculation.

For price prediction:

price = country*w1 + winery*w2 + variety*w3
